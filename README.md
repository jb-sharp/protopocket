# Protein Pocket Detection Prototypes

In this repository, the codes are stored to reproduce the results of the statistical analysis of our method on the ProSPECCTs benchmark.

To reproduce the results, first copy ProSPECCTs ground truth files in the `prospeccts` folder, then run the two scripts `geneomap_training.py` and `geneomap_analysis.py`
